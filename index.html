My GitHub Page. It's a <b>first</b>!! 

<p>Welcome to my Cave! My mundane name is Chris Sherbak, but my online
handle is DruBear, which pretty much covers how I primarily think about
myself: being a <a href="#being%20a%20druid">Druid</a> and a <a
 href="#being%20a%20bear">Bear</a>. </p>

<h2> <a name="being a druid"></a>Being a Druid</h2>
Being a druid means many things to me - most importantly it means
having a worldview that is grounded in ancient values, but watered by
the accumulated knowledge we enjoy today. In less high falutin' terms,
it means I believe in many Gods and Goddesses (the fancy term is
polytheist) and I identify with a number of groups and religions that
have recently emerged which we call NeoPagan. Neo means "new," which we
contrast with Meso-, or Victorian/Fanciful, Pagans of the 17th and 18th
centuries, and the Paleo-, or actual Ancient, Pagans of the early (and
before) Christian Era. (You know, 0 BC and all that...)

<p>I don't worship trees (even though most of 'em are pretty kewl), but
I do regard the Earth as a Goddess, and deserving not only of honor and
respect but having rituals to praise Her and the other Gods and
Goddesses. I don't do blood sacrifice (although the Ancients did, but
not very often) but more likely cookies or barley or beer, depending on
my mood, the Gods' moods or the season. I'm big on seasons, too, even
though nowadays we're not so dependent on knowing when they occur or
making sure it rains when it's supposed to or warm up when we need it.
But keeping track of the cycle of the year is very healthy, and helps
to remind us that we are but passengers on this Spaceship Earth, our
Mother, albeit armed with some pretty nasty in-flight toys that could
make the journey pretty unhealthy for ourselves (not to mention our
fellow travelers.) </p>

I'm not just a packrat in MeatSpace (ask me about the 20 odd boxes of
books waiting for me at my old place in Michigan), but I've been
collecting e-mail addresses for quite some time.
